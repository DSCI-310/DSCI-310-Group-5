First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to our project, which are hosted in the https://github.com/UBC-DSCI on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How Can I Contribute? 

This section guides you through how to contribute as a direct or external partner. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports. Contributions and bug reports are tracked as GitHub issues.

If you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

   - Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
   - Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
   - Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
   - Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
   - Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
   - Include details about your configuration and environment. 
   
Direct contributors:
   - Use issues for listing tasks that need accomplishment, and assignment of tasks.
   - Issues should be linked to project milestones.
   - A Project board is used to organize the issues.
   - Pull at the beginning of each work session, and push at the end.
   - Features and fixes are to be contributed in a GitHub flow workflow (where they create branches for each feature or fix, which are reviewed and critiqued by at least one other teammate before the the pull request is accepted).
   

External Contributors: 
   - External contributors need first to open issues to explain how they might like to help.
