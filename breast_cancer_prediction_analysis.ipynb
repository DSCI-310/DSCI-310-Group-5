    "## I. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we perform data analysis to look for the most efficient model to predict whether it is benign and malignant tumour based on different measurements/traits observed from the data. We use various machine learning algorithms that classify whether a breast tumour is malignant or benign accordingly, and eventually decide on the best algorithm for that task based on recall score. The dataset is obtained from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28original%29\n",
    "\n",
    "## II. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Breast cancer is the development of cancerous tissue of the breast. A malignant (cancerous) tumour can destroy other healthy tissue surrounding it and the disease could potentially metastasize, causing numerous other health complications. However, a tumour might or might not be cancerous. A benign (non-cancerous) tumour will not cause as much harm to the patient compared to a malignant one. With that in mind, an early diagnosis of a **malignant tumour** would give both patients and health care providers valuable time to quickly devise various treatment plans to stop the progression of the disease. This is important especially for a silent killer like cancer, in which the earlier a correct diagnosis has been made, the drastically better the prognosis.\n",
    "This raises the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can we predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based  on the different features observed from the tumour?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",

    "The dataset we use: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set, created by Dr. WIlliam H. Wolberg (physician), contains the following features with 699 observations:\n",

    "From the boxplots above, chromatin and clump feature display the clearest differentiation between benign and malignant tumor. Benign tumors seem to have clump thickness and bland chromatin on the lower ends. These characteristics are also displayed clearly in the histograms. Moreover, it might not be as obvious in boxplot, but in histogram, the majority of benign tumors is on the lower end of the nuclei's spectrum while the majority of malignant tumors are on the upper end. This suggests tumors with higher values of clump thickness, chromatin and nuclei have a higher chance of being malignant. \n",

    "As for unif_size, unif_shape, adhesion and nucleoli, the histograms show that regarding to benign tumors, these features tend to range in small values while malignant tumors' ranges are more evenly spread out.

Moreover, from the plot above (Figure 3), we can see that out of 205 observations in test set, we only falsely predict 1 tumor to be benign and 2 tumors to malignant. This aligns with our decision at the beginning of the project which is to optimize recall score of the model. \n",

    "The boxplots and histograms allow us to see how the displayed data is distributed across our dataset and how they differentiate benign and malignant tumors. We believe certain variables will give us significantly more information on how to correctly classify a tumor. Such features which can play a decisive factor in prediction task are: \n",
    "\n",
    "Nucleoli (Figures 1.7 & 2.7): This feature plays an important role in classifying tumor types as shown in both plots. Observing (1.7) we notice that benign tumors tend to have a nucleoli value in between 0 and 2 (for discrete values), and we primarily see malignant tumors for values greater than 2. This is further supported in (2.7), where we see that only outliers from benign tumors are entangled with the malignant tumor's box and lower whisker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chromatin (Figures 1.6 & 2.6): It is a variable which at first sight could serve us as a way to determine the class label for a given test example. The problem with this variable is the intersection between 2 & 4 in the x axis for figure (1.6). This is problematic because the probability of falsely predicting an observation increases if the value of chromatin of said observation lies within that given interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other variables like nuclei or adhesion can also be useful, but if we were able to set them only for certain values of the \"x\" variable. The problem is that if we, for example, take nuclei as the decisive rule to classify, we would have almost a 50/50 chance of correctly classifying it if \"x\" was between 2 and 4 approximately. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Methods & Results*\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing cross-val scores (recall scores) among kNN, Decision Tree, and Logistics Regression, we found that kNN performs the best with highest recall score. By using `GridSearchCV` to computationally optimize the hyperparameters for `KNeighborsClassifier`, it turns out our best model is `KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5, weights='uniform')` with **98.5% overall accuracy, 99% recall, 98% precision and an F1-score of 98%** when deploying on test set. This means that the model generalized very well for this prediction problem, and with such a high recall we also achieved our goal of maximizing the True Positive and minimizing the False Negative instances, which would be of tremendous importance when it comes to computational-aided medical diagnostic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impacts of our Findings\n",
    "We hope to aid other researchers and medical professionals in breast cancer diagnostic process and treatment with our results. We also hope to inspire other researchers to build upon what we have to continually improve this machine learning model, or take on a different perspective and build other technologies that will hopefully be more powerful and geared towards the task than what we developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Questions and Research Area\n",
    "1. Are there any other features related to cancer tissue, either unique to breast cancer or universal to all types of cancer, that can further improve the accuracy metrics of machine learning models?\n",
    "1. Is there a better machine learning algorithm that could be seen as the most \"optimal\" to this prediction task?\n",
    "1. Develop a better systematic approach/procedure between medical professional and these technologies to diagnose breast cancer more efficiently.\n",
    "1. Research into developing better technologies, not limited to AI/ML, to aid with breast cancer (or any cancer) diagnostic.\n",
