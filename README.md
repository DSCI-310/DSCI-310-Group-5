## Summary
The present project seeks to provide a prediction to the problematic of spotting clear patterns of benign and malignant tumours, which comes from the question "Is there a way to efficiently classify whether a tumour is malignant or benign with high accuracy, based  on the different features observed from the tumour in its development stage, using the support of the  computing technologies currently available?". 
Such problematic was resolved using a predictive model. Our initial hypothesis was that .
After implementing EDA methods, like summary statistics and data cleaning and visualization, 
we performed a Logistic Regression model to see if our hypothesis was right. The outputs predicted that 

## Instructions for Execution
